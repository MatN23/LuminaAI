# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the LuminaAI community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing deep learning research and engineering.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* **Technical Excellence**: Sharing well-tested code, thoughtful architecture decisions, and performance benchmarks
* **Constructive Feedback**: Providing specific, actionable suggestions with reasoning
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Documenting discoveries, optimization techniques, and debugging approaches
* **Collaboration**: Working together on complex challenges like training stability and architecture improvements
* **Respect**: Acknowledging different experience levels and learning approaches
* **Transparency**: Being honest about limitations, bugs, and experimental features
* **Reproducibility**: Providing clear instructions, configurations, and environment details

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Harassment, discriminatory comments, or personal attacks
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Trolling, inflammatory comments, or deliberate disruption
* Sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Deliberately introducing malicious code or security vulnerabilities
* Misrepresenting benchmark results or experimental findings

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Communication channels (if established)
* Events or meetups related to the project
* Representing the project in public spaces

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (usernames) of individuals involved
* Description of the incident
* Links to relevant content (issues, comments, etc.)
* Any additional context

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Technical Conduct

### Code Quality Standards

Contributors are expected to:

* **Test thoroughly**: Include unit tests and integration tests for new features
* **Document clearly**: Provide docstrings, comments, and README updates
* **Follow conventions**: Adhere to existing code style and patterns
* **Benchmark responsibly**: Report accurate performance metrics with hardware specs
* **Handle errors**: Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
* **Consider impact**: Evaluate memory usage, training stability, and edge cases

### Research Integrity

When contributing research-based features:

* Cite original papers and implementations
* Clearly mark experimental or unvalidated approaches
* Provide reproducible configurations
* Be transparent about limitations and failure modes
* Share negative results to help others avoid pitfalls

### Security

* Never commit API keys, credentials, or sensitive data
* Report security vulnerabilities privately to maintainers
* Follow responsible disclosure practices
* Test security implications of new features
