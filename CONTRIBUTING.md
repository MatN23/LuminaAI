## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

1. **Bug Fixes**: Fix training instabilities, crashes, or incorrect behavior
2. **Features**: Add new architectures, optimizers, or training techniques
3. **Performance**: Optimize throughput, memory usage, or convergence
4. **Documentation**: Improve guides, docstrings, or examples
5. **Tests**: Add test coverage for untested components
6. **Research**: Implement papers or experimental techniques

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/matn23/luminaai/issues) page
- Look for labels:
  - `good first issue`: Great for newcomers
  - `help wanted`: Maintainers need assistance
  - `bug`: Known issues needing fixes
  - `enhancement`: New features or improvements
  - `documentation`: Docs improvements
  - `performance`: Optimization opportunities

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check for existing work**: Search issues and PRs to avoid duplication
2. **Discuss major changes**: Open an issue first for significant features
3. **Assign yourself**: Comment on the issue to claim it
4. **Ask questions**: Reach out if you need clarification

---

## Code Standards

### Code Style

- **Python Style**: Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black default)
- **Imports**: Use `isort` for consistent import ordering
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/methods: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Documentation Standards

#### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def adjust_capacity_factor(self, new_factor: float) -> None:
    """Dynamically adjust MoE capacity factor during training.
    
    This method modifies how many tokens can be routed to each expert,
    affecting load balancing and training stability.
    
    Args:
        new_factor: New capacity factor (typically 1.0-2.0).
            Higher values allow more tokens per expert but increase
            memory usage. Lower values improve efficiency but may
            cause token dropping.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If new_factor <= 0.
        
    Example:
        >>> trainer.adjust_capacity_factor(1.5)
        >>> # Allows 50% more tokens per expert
        
    Note:
        Changes take effect on the next forward pass. This is safe
        to call during training.
    """
    if new_factor <= 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Capacity factor must be positive, got {new_factor}")
    
    self.config.capacity_factor = new_factor
    self.logger.info(f"Adjusted capacity factor to {new_factor}")
```

#### Comments

- **Why over what**: Explain reasoning, not obvious operations
- **Complex logic**: Add comments for non-trivial algorithms
- **TODOs**: Include TODOs with issue numbers when applicable

```python
# Good: Explains why
# Use emergency LR reduction to prevent gradient explosion
# rather than simple clipping, which masks the underlying issue
self.emergency_lr_reduction(factor=10.0)

# Bad: States the obvious
# Reduce learning rate
self.learning_rate *= 0.1
```

### Architecture Principles

Follow these design principles from the codebase:

1. **Autonomy**: Systems should self-optimize when possible
2. **Observability**: Expose metrics for monitoring and debugging
3. **Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully with automatic recovery
4. **Flexibility**: Support multiple architectures and configurations
5. **Production-Ready**: Include error handling, logging, and checkpointing

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/                 # Unit tests for individual components
│   ├── test_trainer.py
│   ├── test_model.py
│   └── test_config.py
├── integration/          # Integration tests for workflows
│   ├── test_training_loop.py
│   └── test_checkpointing.py
└── fixtures/             # Shared test data and fixtures
    └── sample_configs.py
```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
import torch
from src.trainer import Trainer

class TestTrainer:
    @pytest.fixture
    def trainer(self):
        """Create a minimal trainer for testing."""
        config = Config(
            hidden_size=128,
            num_layers=2,
            num_heads=4,
            vocab_size=1000
        )
        return Trainer(config)
    
    def test_adjust_capacity_factor(self, trainer):
        """Test capacity factor adjustment."""
        original = trainer.config.capacity_factor
        trainer.adjust_capacity_factor(2.0)
        assert trainer.config.capacity_factor == 2.0
        assert trainer.config.capacity_factor != original
    
    def test_adjust_capacity_factor_invalid(self, trainer):
        """Test capacity factor validation."""
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            trainer.adjust_capacity_factor(-1.0)
    
    @pytest.mark.skipif(not torch.cuda.is_available(), reason="CUDA required")
    def test_training_on_gpu(self, trainer):
        """Test training stability on GPU."""
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum coverage**: Aim for 80% coverage on new code
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for training loop, checkpointing, recovery
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Hardware**: Mark hardware-specific tests with appropriate decorators

### Performance Testing

For optimization PRs, include benchmarks:

```python
def test_flash_attention_speedup():
    """Verify Flash Attention improves throughput."""
    baseline_throughput = benchmark_without_flash_attention()
    optimized_throughput = benchmark_with_flash_attention()
    
    assert optimized_throughput > baseline_throughput * 1.5  # At least 1.5x faster
```
