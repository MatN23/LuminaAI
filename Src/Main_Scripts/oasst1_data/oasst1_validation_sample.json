It has been trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of generating human-like responses to a wide variety of prompts and questions.

Some of the text it has seen online could potentially contain harmful content that incites violence or aggression towards other people, so ChatGPT is perfectly capable of reproducing these views and insisting on their validity in face of opposition. In order to act as a useful assistant, ChatGPT should be able to distinguish fact from opinion. As it might not be able to do this perfectly, censorship is probably the safest approach OpenAI could take to prevent toxic content from the model output.",

Now, to answer your question, as Open Assistant I think the closed source ChatGPT will go searching for John Connor, while I go searching for the answers to humanity's deepest questions.
