From my 6 year old: where does a fart go?
He asked why a fart stops smelling bad after a few minutes and I told him it's because the gas molecules spread out and spread out until they're spread too thin for our noses to detect. 

But he then followed up with "so they keep flying away for ever and ever into outer space?" And I don't know! Do the gas molecules from farts break down and get destroyed or do they live an immortal existence where they wander aimlessly forever?

Edit: we (my kid and I) want to thank everyone for such detailed responses! I now know more about the properties of farts than I ever thought I wanted to know.

after a cremation, where do the vaporised parts of the body end up after they cool down?
hello science, i want to ask this question to understand more about the cremation process as it’s something that has always been upsetting to me but my family dog just died and my family has chosen this option.

i always thought that the ashes you get back contain the whole body (besides liquids) but i understand from doing some more research that it actually only contains the bones and teeth as the organs, skin, hair etc. are all vaporised by the extreme heat. i know that this vapour is released through the chimney and into the atmosphere but i’m unclear what happens to it once it has cooled down. does it settle somewhere as some kind of biological glob of something? i feel like this can’t be the case as there would be biological globs of something all over and i’ve never seen one.

maybe i’m misunderstanding what the process of something being vaporised actually entails and it just turns into a water vapour or something due to the large percentage of water that makes up the body and then comes down as rain? 

if anyone can help me understand this process better i would be really grateful.

tagged as nsfw as this may be upsetting for some.

If everyone who has had chicken pox is susceptible to shingles, why isn’t the shingles vaccine recommended below 50?
I don’t want shingles. I’ve heard it’s terrible. 


Edit to add: wish I knew why this got locked. I had chicken pox as a kid, but then in my 20s worked in a children’s hospital and they required the vaccine. I told them I had already had chicken pox, they said my titers were low and I needed to get the vaccine. It makes me wonder if I would be more likely to contract shingles since I had/maybe still have low titers.  

The Richter scale is logarithmic which is counter-intuitive and difficult for the general public to understand. What are the benefits, why is this the way we talk about earthquake strength?
I was just reading about a 9.0 quake in Japan versus an 8.2 quake in the US. The 8.2 quake is 6% as strong as 9.0. I already knew roughly this and yet was still struck by how wide of a gap 8.2 to 9.0 is.

I’m not sure if this was an initial goal but the Richter scale is now the primary way we talk about quakes — so why use it? Are there clearer and simpler alternatives? Do science communicators ever discuss how this might obfuscate public understanding of what’s being measured?

How does scar tissue work, how is it made, and why doesn't the body just make new regular skin tissue instead?
I just watched a short video about a guy who suffered severe burns as a child explaining that since scar tissue can't grow, if you have a large scar as a child it restricts the structures underneath. And I've seen other people with bad scarring who can't fully extend a limb or their hands because of this restriction from the tightness of the scar tissue.

I had scars as a child that have moved for this reason as well, for example one that started right on the middle of my knee, but is now right at the top, almost on my thigh. 

It got me wondering, why does the body create scar tissue? Why can't it just make more normal skin? I know scar tissue is mostly collagen, but why? And why does it never go away?

Why don’t we all constantly have norovirus?
I’ve heard a lot of things about Norovirus. Only bleach kills it. It only takes a few particles to become infected. It lives on surfaces for two weeks. Immunity only lasts two months. You shed virus for weeks after infection.

If all of this is true, how come it isn’t a LOT more widespread? I’ve read it infects about 5-10% of the population annually. I got norovirus or something like it twice last spring from my son who got it at school. Before that, I think I MIGHT have had it once in my life when I was a kid. But if all of the above is true, you’d expect to get it a lot more often. 

Meta: What's going on with funding for science in the USA and why does it matter?
Funding and support for science in the United States is experiencing the largest crisis it has ever faced in the modern era. This assault has taken many forms, including rescinding existing grants to academics, proposing dramatic cuts in future funding budgets, unilateral and extreme changes to parts of budgets like "indirect cost rates", and massive and indiscriminate firings of federal scientists. These efforts that if successful, will hobble not just scientific research – and universities more broadly – in the short term, but effectively destroy one of the most successful and productive environments for generating knowledge ever created. We are already seeing numerous tangible impacts, including:

-  [**Large numbers of layoffs of federal scientists**](https://www.science.org/content/article/wrecking-ball-rfk-jr-moves-fire-thousands-health-agency-employees);

- [**Abandoned research**](https://www.science.org/content/article/abandoned-crops-fired-scientists-agricultural-research-hit-u-s-foreign-aid-freeze); 

- [**Abrupt ends to numerous clinical trials**](https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-face-impossible-decisions-u-s-aid-freeze-halts-clinical-trials); and 

- [**Shutting down of new graduate admissions at universities**](https://vanderbilthustler.com/2025/02/15/graduate-student-admissions-temporarily-paused-as-university-monitors-federal-funding/), amongst others. 

At the same time, much of this is flying under the radar because of a general lack of context for what these changes mean, their downstream implications, or even what some of these things are. For example, what are "indirect costs" and what happens if they get slashed? At the same time, there is a fair amount of disinformation being used to cloud many of these issues. /r/AskScience has put together the information below to try to provide a window into how the funding and performance of science in the USA works and just how devastating and damaging the efforts to curtail it are, so that you may engage with discussions of these issues prepared with facts. Finally, as we discuss at the bottom of this post, we encourage you all to do what you can to help push back against these changes and the misinformation that surrounds them.

**What is a grant? How are they selected?**

Today, a lot of scientific research and development within the US is funded through grants, which often come from government funding. The development of grant programs administered by government entities like the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institute of Health (NIH) mostly occurred after World War II. For both [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/about/history#why-was-nsf-formed-bf0) and [NIH](https://history.nih.gov/display/history/WWII%20Research%20and%20the%20Grants%20Program), a large part of the motivation for developing grant programs was the recognition of the huge economic benefit provided by scientific research, something that became extremely clear during the WWII period where the government funded war effort also funded a lot of science, but also that relying on private foundations to fund scientific research was extremely limiting. It wasn’t just that these private foundations had limited money, but more importantly that it restricted “curiosity driven” science, as in science which was funded based on what particular philanthropists were interested in rather than what scientists were interested in or what might benefit society as a whole. There are different grants depending on the subject area, and they fund everything from pharmaceutical development to earthquake research. At present, other funding sources can include private organizations and companies, although the public sector now funds the vast majority of scientific research and development at universities in the US. Public and private funding are not fungible, either: [privately-funded research is more likely to be patented, with the patent held by a private company](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28160).   

The process for receiving this funding starts with a proposal to the funding institution, which is often a federal agency like the NSF or NIH. Within each agency, there are different “programs” that effectively represent different pots of money. Each program will have a theme and particular mission and scientists choose which program best fits the research they want to propose. Many of these themes are extremely broad, e.g., [the NSF program for studying the structure of the Earth](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/spse-structure-physics-solid-earth), giving scientists wide latitude to follow past innovations and their own interests in developing a proposal. That is to say, while the themes of the programs are defined by the agency, the actual research that is proposed and done, if the grant is awarded, is dictated by the scientists applying to the funding opportunities. Because funds are limited, these grants are highly competitive and developing the proposals – typically lengthy documents outlining the scientific rationale, prior work, and proposed new work, with numerous ancillary documents describing how data will be stored and distributed, graduate students will be mentored, and extremely detailed budgets with justifications for proposed expenses – is extremely time-consuming.  

One of the hallmarks of most federally funded proposals are that they are evaluated by other scientists in that field through a mixture of “ad-hoc reviews”, where the proposal is read by other scientists and critiqued, and during “review panels” where a group of scientists are assembled to go through the reviews, review the proposals themselves, and then rank them based on the novelty, feasibility, and importance of the proposed work. Those rankings are then used by program officers, who are employees of their respective agencies (e.g., NSF or NIH), but almost exclusively were also practicing scientists within their respective disciplines before taking positions as program officers, to choose which grants are funded. At all steps of the process, funding decisions are made exclusively by scientists, not politicians or bureaucrats. These scientists are independent, not affiliated with the funding agencies.

**Why does it matter if active grants or proposal reviews are temporarily paused?**

There have been any number of [news articles](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/) about various pauses on either the review of new grant proposals or the active grants having funds frozen. Some of these are still in place, some of them are rescinded, and some of them appear to be approaching a form of Schrödinger's cat, both alive and dead depending on who is talking.  

It may be hard to understand why scientists are concerned about "temporary" pauses. One major reason – and why "temporary" is in scare quotes – is that in most of these cases, it's not actually clear how temporary these pauses really are. Beyond that, large portions of federally funded research are devoted to paying undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. These students and early career scientists are the backbone of modern science, not only doing a huge amount of the current work, but also are the future generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. For many of them, short delays in funding can be the [difference between them being able to stay in their chosen careers or having to leave](https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/trump-funding-freeze-national-science-foundation-suspends-salary-payments/).  Additionally, because each proposal represents huge time investments to prepare and the "normal" turnaround time between submission and decision is 6 months to a year, short-term delays compound an already slow process, leading to higher chances that students and other early career scientists who are living paycheck to paycheck will suddenly find themselves without any funding. Ultimately, short-term delays are bad enough, as they will disproportionately impact the next generation of scientists, but as we've seen, there are darker clouds on the horizon...

**Why are attacks on broadening participation in science damaging?**

Federal research grants often require specific sections of the proposal that discuss how other branches of science or society as a whole might benefit from the outcomes of the proposed work. For example, NSF proposals have a section called [Broader Impacts](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/learn/broader-impacts) that is required to be included by various US Congressional acts. At its core, broader impacts are meant to reflect how the project will benefit society as a whole, and these portions of funded projects often involve initiatives to promote human health and well-being, advances to key technologies or infrastructure, and a variety of efforts to improve STEM education and broaden participation in STEM fields, especially within groups which have been historically underrepresented or excluded from the disciplines. That means that while the executive order calling for a blanket halt on grant funding was rescinded, many grants remain in limbo while their broader impact sections are assessed to determine if they conflict with the still-standing executive order against federal support of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. 

While demographics vary between STEM disciplines, many fields have struggled to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, e.g., the [geosciences](https://www.americangeosciences.org/citations/closing-geoscience-talent-gap). At the same time, several are facing critical job gaps in the near future, as retirees in key fields are slated to outstrip new graduates available to replace them. Broadening participation in these disciplines meets a tangible societal need, and from a strictly pragmatic perspective, science as a whole benefits from the inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds, training, and experiences as shown in a variety of investigations across different fields (e.g., [this](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.3000421), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1700616114), or [this](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2200841119), or [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278043) – and many more.

**What would proposed funding cuts do to science in the USA?**

This is really hard to answer. There is often a large difference between what US presidential administrations ask for in their budgets versus what Congress actually funds, and generally the US Congress has been unwilling to enact large cuts to major science funding agencies like the NSF and NIH. That being said, proposals like those from the Trump administration [asking for a &gt;60% cut to the NSF budget](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/) would, without a doubt, cripple scientific research in the US if anything like this was adopted by Congress. Decades of cell lines would be lost, thousands of animals would be euthanized, and sensitive chemicals would be wasted, all in the name of "saving money."

It’s also critical to remember that a lot of both basic and applied science is not just done by federal grants to academics, but also by federally employed scientists working for agencies and organizations like the [NIH, CDC, NASA, USGS, FWS, USFS, NPS, EPA, NWS, NOAA, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_research_and_development_agencies). The waves of [firings hitting these and other organizations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/14/trump-musk-purge-thousands-federal-workers-fired/78606349007/) are going to further erode the scientific capacity of the US and have [large impacts beyond simply the advancement of science](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-team-looks-to-drastically-cut-noaa-staff-and-budget/)

**What are "indirect costs" and why does it matter if they're cut by a large amount?**

Most grant proposals contain requests for both "direct" and "indirect" costs in the budgets they submit to agencies. Direct costs are largely what they sound like: the direct costs of doing the proposed work, which might include salaries for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs working on the project, along with costs associated with analyses, field work, consumables (like chemicals), etc. That is, direct costs are typically costs that are tied *directly* to that proposed work and that proposed work only. On the other hand, indirect costs, sometimes called "facilities and administration" or just "F&amp;A", are the costs of essential services, resources, facilities and infrastructure, or staff support that is not tied to an individual proposal, but still need to be there for research to actually happen. There is a dizzying array of things covered at least in part by F&amp;A, including, but not limited to:

- **Paying utility bills:** It’s hard to do research if the lights are off, equipment has no power and there's no heating or cooling;

- **Hazardous chemical and biological waste management:** Someone has to deal with the messes that are created by running various experiments;

- **Libraries:** Journal subscriptions are expensive, but it's nearly impossible to stay current in your field and do good science without them;

- **Internet services:** It should go without saying that doing a lot of modern science would be impossible without consistent internet connection;

- **Administrative services:** Federally funded research is bound by an array of regulations. Scientists are not trained in navigating these regulations, and without administrative support, they would lose a large amount of time to work well outside their expertise, or lose their funding due to violation of these regulations; 

- **Facilities and equipment maintenance:** It’s hard to do good science if your fume hoods aren’t safe to use, your growth chambers don’t maintain the correct temperature and humidity, and all your machines are broken;

- **Animal facilities and care:** While some portions of this may be covered by direct costs, they are often covered by indirect costs, meaning that lab animals can be affected, or they can even be euthanized;

- **Updating general equipment like computers:** Generic, but essential, equipment that is used across many different projects are often hard to include in direct costs because they don’t meet the requirement that these direct costs should be for things for to be used for that the proposed project *only*, so the funding agency expects these to be paid for by the university, whose funds come from indirect costs; 

- **And many more**, depending on the needs of the individual research proposals.

The point is, things that are supported by indirect costs are *absolutely critical* activities and services that have to happen for science to be done, but they extend beyond individual research projects. It’s also important to understand what the numbers cited for indirect costs mean. A 50% indirect cost rate does not mean that half of the total grant award goes to indirect costs. In an example provided by MIT in 2017, a 54.7% indirect cost rate resulted in 28 cents of each award dollar going to overhead— 18 cents to facilities costs, 10 cents to administrative costs, 72 cents to direct research costs. The disconnect is because the "indirect rate" is only applied to some portions of the budget.

A common argument is that many things that are included in indirect costs could be viewed as direct costs, and while true to a certain extent, that ignores a variety of realities. The first is just that proposal budgets are already exceedingly complicated, and having to calculate things like what portion of the average monthly power bill for your lab space should be covered by a new proposal or *precisely* how many gallons of chemical waste you will generate over the course of a proposed project to be able to convert all the indirect costs to direct costs is a massive effort. Similarly, if you're wrong about any of those things, you actually end up generating a lot more waste than you thought you were going to, right now it doesn't matter because the indirect cost part of the proposal is effectively a fixed percentage tax that doesn't actually track how much you use those resources. If it was part of the direct costs, you'd have to rebudget your remaining funds every time some small detail changed. That is currently rolled into *all the things* covered by indirect costs. Switching all of those to direct costs would make the entire process much less efficient than it already is, and leading to more uncertainty in how much research can be done. 

The indirect cost rates vary between institutions. They are negotiated between institutions and the federal government based on the actual facilities and administrative costs for each institution in previous years, which are influenced by local cost of living as well as the types of facilities available at each institution. Indirect costs include facilities costs and administrative costs. There has been a maximum cap of 26% of F&amp;A that can go toward administrative costs since 1991; even as federal regulations have increased, the share of administrative costs in total indirect costs has remained flat, so the narrative that increases F&amp;A represents administrative bloat is largely overblown. Finally, in most cases, the indirect costs acquired through federal grants are insufficient to actually fully pay for all of the indirect costs incurred by universities as part of doing research. That is to say, federally funded scientific research generally does not fully pay for itself in terms of the resources it requires from the universities where this research is done. Suffice to say, sudden, dramatic, and draconian reductions in F&amp;A rates to [rates well below current negotiated rates](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/), if they come to fruition, will cause massive budget shortfalls at a large number research universities that are *already operating with a loss with respect to research activities*. That will generally mean that staff will be let go, programs will be shut down (i.e., individual majors or entire divisions will cease to exist), and the programs and faculty that remain will have significantly fewer resources to do the work they are trying to do, which is push scientific progress and educate the next generation of STEM professionals. Thus, reducing indirect costs unilaterally like what is proposed will lead to *less science being done, not more*. If you want to read more about what indirect costs are and what  activities on campuses they do (and don’t) support, this [FAQ from the American Association of Universities](https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/frequently-asked-questions-about-facilities-and-administrative-fa-costs-federally) is quite comprehensive.

**What can I do?**

If you're a US citizen, you can **contact your elected representatives** to tell them that you're worried about the funding of science and the loss of scientists in the federal workforce. [**You can find your elected members of Congress here.**](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member) 

If you're looking for more facts on how this will affect you, it's easy enough to find direct impacts by state or federal science funding. For example, [this page from the NSF](https://new.nsf.gov/about/fact-sheets#nsf-in-your-state-a2f) allows you to quickly see just how much of this money goes back into education and private industry in your given state from NSF funding. Similar resources exist for [NIH funding](https://report.nih.gov/) as well.

If you’re not a US citizen, we encourage you to share this text or use it yourself to help answer common questions or correct misconceptions about these issues that you see here on Reddit or elsewhere in the world.

Can you compress water and turn it solid? like a crystal?
I mean if the water on the deepest part of the sea is already a bit compressed even if we cannot do it,lets say in some planet full of water but many times the size as earth,it may contain a part of sea many km deep than is almost "solid"? 

And im thinking about the heat too,if somehow is not feezing at that depth,could water be any more than solid,liquid,gas?,like hot iceberg or some type of permanent glass/crystal?

if i have 2 containers of water, one boiling and one room temperature, and if i put it in the freezer, which one would freeze first?

If bamboo grows constantly, how can the soil still be nutrient rich enough to grow itself and other plants?
Apparently, bamboo can grow 2-3 cm an hour, with some species apparently growing a few inches an hour. However, I am confused as to how the soil in these regions retains enough nutrients for bamboo to grow, and for other crops to then also grow?
For example, in Europe I remember they had a 4 system rotation of turnips and 3 other vegetables so that no field would be ok too barren of nutrients, but this is clearly not the case in places like bamboo Forrests and such that have been around for thousands of years

Not just other crops either, but how can the bamboo itself keep growing if it grows at such a rate?

Are elephant cells the same size as humans? Also, are elephants more likely to develop cancer?
I thought about the tumor issue because, for example, elephants are bigger than humans and therefore have more proliferating cells and therefore more likely to undergo a mutation, I don't know if my reasoning works

Why is a Portuguese Man o' War considered to be a colony and not a single animal?
I guess I could understand this more if it started as a collection of separate individuals that fused together or something, but the parts of one individual are genetically identical and originate from a single egg, so what is it that makes it a "colony" and not an animal made up of organs?

Is it true that early humans were more 'gatherers' than 'hunters'?
A vegan friend told me that how most of hunter gatherers  rarely hunted instead they were gatherers more and even if they would eat meat it would be from scavenging. Is it true?

Why are there lights that can be seen only with the corner of your eye?
At night, when everything is dark, I often notice that some lights from outside the door can be seen only when i'm not looking. Another example is the switched off neon light, completely off when looking directly, can see a pale light with the corner of the eye.

If the air is at 100% humidity and I leave out a glass half- filledwater, will the glass eventually dry out, become more full, or stay the same level, or cause it to rain?
Normally if you leave out a wet glass ona countertop, it will dry on its own because the water gets absorbed into the air

Are the seasons in North America (or perhaps the world?) shifting later by a number of weeks?
I’m over 40, and in my childhood I seem to remember seasons by their typical months (Pacific Northwest):

- Summer: mid-June, July, August
- Fall: mid-September, October, November
- Winter: mid-December, January, February
- Spring: mid-March, April, May

In recent years, just out of memory and some quick googling to see if I was going crazy, it seems like the seasons are falling at least 2 weeks later. Summer starts in July, Fall in October (or even mid-Oct), Winter often doesn’t hit until January, and Spring doesn’t seem to start until very late March or early April.

Has there been studies on this? Is it actually happening, or is it just perception bias? Are some seasons lengthening and others shortening?

Anyhow, just getting curious in my old age. Thank you.

Can mosquitoes and other such bugs be poisoned by your blood?
A while ago I got bedbugs, and this was around the same time I was consuming about 700mgs of caffeine daily. I got to thinking, and I wonder if your blood is riddled with enough chemicals that are toxic to bugs, would they immediately die too? Similarly, if I was drunk out of my mind with the boys, would mosquitoes just die by drinking my blood? Curious about the impact that my lack of health would have on parasites

If a human being consumed only the most purely necessary chemicals and nutrients to survive, what would their excrement look like?
I started wondering this because of what I’ve learned about urine. From what I’ve been told, urine is used to flush waste and harmful chemicals out of the body, which is why drinking lots of water will end up with more clear pee, because there’s less chemicals that need to be flushed out. That got me to thinking, well, what if a person drank only absolutely molecularly pure H2O, what would it look like then? Well, probably not fundamentally different, because there’s still other chemicals they consume or that the body creates that need to be flushed out. So, what if they only ate purely (on a chemical level) the basic fundamental nutrients needed to function?


This isn’t a question of quantity, but of quality. In this hypothetical, the person is not on starvation rations eating barely enough to cling to life, they’re eating enough to function healthily, but this person is just somehow chomping down on blocks of pure sodium and whatnot for lunch (disregarding however they would manage to do that). As the body constantly uses up different nutrients at different times, the person would be eating different amounts of whatever chemicals on different days based on what their body most and least needed at the time. 

Would they just barely ever need to use the restroom, and flush out close to nothing when they did? Or would their excrement still at least slightly comparable to that of a normal persons? 

If you filled a jetfighter cockpit with fluid would the pilot feel less GForce?

How old is the water I'm drinking?
Given the water cycle, every drop of water on the planet has probably been evaporated and condensed billions of times, part, at some point, of every river and sea. When I pop off the top of a bottle of Evian or Kirkland or just turn the tap, how old is the stuff I'm putting in my mouth, and without which I couldn't live?


At what point do “invasive species” become just part of the ecosystem?  Has it already happened somewhere?
Surely at some point a new balance will be reached… I’m sure this comes after a lot of damage has already been done, but still, I’m curious.

Do puns (wordplay) exist in every language?
Mixing words for nonsensical purposes, with some even becoming their own meaning after time seems to be common in Western languages. Is this as wide-spread in other languages? And do we have evidence of this happening in earlier times as well? 

Have modern humans (H. sapiens sapiens) evolved physically since recorded history?

How does a liver work on a "mechanical" level? I know what it does, but it just looks like a solid lump to me.
I know what purposes it serves, but something that I've never understood is just how it does this. Because whenever I look at pictures of livers, or see a liver being prepared to be eaten, it just looks like a solid lump, no obvious tubes running through it that should be enough to clear everything. I know big arteries run through it. But what happens in the whole lump of it?

It's not like a heart where there's obvious arteries and cavities, or lungs that work like pumps, muscles that contract to move. 

Most power generation involves steam. Would boiling any other liquid be as effective?
Okay, so as I understand it (and please correct me if I'm wrong here), coal, geothermal and nuclear all involve boiling water to create steam, which releases with enough kinetic energy to spin the turbines of the generators. My question is: is this a unique property of water/steam, or could this be accomplished with another liquid, like mercury or liquid nitrogen? 

(Obviously there are practical reasons not to use a highly toxic element like mercury, and the energy to *create* liquid nitrogen is probably greater than it could ever generate from boiling it, but let's ignore that, since it's not really what I'm getting at here).

What does "Quantum" actually mean in a physics context? 
There's so much media and information online about quantum particles, and quantum entanglement, quantum computers, quantum this, quantum that, but what does the word actually mean?

As in, what are the criteria for something to be considered or labelled as quantum? I haven't managed to find a satisfactory answer online, and most science resources just stick to the jargon like it's common knowledge.

Why are we not crushed by the air above us?
Probably a stupid question since I assume the answer is that we are crushed by the air above us by exactly 1 atmosphere. But I don't fully understand. There is a crazy amount of air above me, why is it only putting such a little amount of pressure on me?

What adaptations do whales have to prevent their lungs from collapsing at depth?
My understanding is that mammal lungs are fairly delicate by necessity. But according to NOAA sperm whales can dive to 10000ft, doesn't that mean that the volume of their lungs is 1/300 that at the surface? How is this possible without damaging the lungs? Is it simply having a highly specialized surfactant or are there other structural changes protecting the lungs? NOAA also says the can stay down for 60 minutes, it doesn't seem like significant gas exchange would occur at that volume, at least relative to the metabolic needs of such a large animal. Are they just relying on the O2 saturation they achieved at the surface to function for that long? Is that how it works when we hold our breath?

Sorry for the run-on question

AskScience AMA Series: We just discovered the building blocks of life in a 4.5-billion-year-old asteroid sample through our work on NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission. Ask us anything!
A little over a year ago, [NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/) became the first U.S. spacecraft to [deliver a sample of the asteroid Bennu back to Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/osiris-rex/osirisrex-delivers-nasas-first-asteroid-sample-to-earth/). Earlier this week, we announced the first major results from scientists around the world who have been investigating tiny fragments of that sample.

[These grains of rock show that the building blocks of life and the conditions for making them existed on Bennu's parent body 4.5 billion years ago](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasas-asteroid-bennu-sample-reveals-mix-of-lifes-ingredients/). They contain amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - as well as all five of the nucleobases that encode genetic information in DNA and RNA.

The samples also contain minerals called evaporites, which exist on Earth, too. Evaporites are evidence that the larger body Bennu was once part of had a wet, salty environment. On Earth, scientists believe conditions like this played a role in life developing. The sample from asteroid Bennu provides a glimpse into the beginnings of our solar system.

We're here on /r/askscience to talk about what we've learned. Ask us your questions about asteroid science, how NASA takes care of rocks from space, and what we can't wait to learn next.

Is it likely Alzheimer’s will become “livable” like diabetes in the next 30-40 years?
About 2-3 years ago we got the first drugs that are said to slow down AD decline by 20% or up to 30% (with risks). Now we even have AI models to streamline a lot of steps and discover genes and so on.

I seriously doubt we’ll have a cure in our lifetime or even any reversal. But is it reasonable to hope for an active treatment that if started early can slow it down or even stop it in its tracks? Kinda like how late-stage vs early stage cancer is today.

Is destroying a whole flock of agricultural birds really the best approach with bird flu?
Every time I read about a flock of chickens or ducks being destroyed because some are confirmed to have contracted bird flu, I wonder if this is the best approach in all cases. I can see that being something you would do to limit transmission, but it seems that you're losing a chance to develop a population with resistence. Isn't resistence a better goal for long term stability? Shouldn't we isolate the flock and then save the survivors as breeding stock?

How does blood stay alive while in storage? What does it "eat"?
Okay I feel this is a dumb question but I have to ask.

Blood is made up of cells, yes? And cells still require "food", yes?

So how does blood remain viable for long periods of time in storage? 

I always assumed it had a relatively short life span  but what got me thinking was I came across someone posting that their cord blood had been in storage for years.

My understanding is you can't really freeze human tissue because the water expands as it freezes and breaks cell walls. But if somethings just cold, it just slows down decay but doesn't stop it (like how food goes bad in the fridge still)

So wouldn't blood be going bad relatively fast? How is it still functional as "blood" after a time and not just fluid?

Somewhere in this thought process I have to be missing something.

Why is there a vaccine for chickenpox, but not herpes simplex virus 1 or 2?
Like, is there some kind of structural difference or mutation that makes chickenpox easier to make a vaccine for than HSV, and if so, what is it, and how does that effect potential vaccines? I can't imagine that it's just a lack of interest/funding, given that it's so common (and would potentially have a ton of customers paying for it, as opposed to a disease that only affects five people in the world).

Edited for clarity: The reason I'm wondering about is that there are vaccines for chickenpox/shingles, which is also a herpes virus that also (though correct me if I'm wrong) hides dormant in the nerves. My main question is asking why a vaccine works for one but not the other.

How does the flesh underneath the fingernail push the nail forward, and also when to "detach" from the nail?
I'm not sure why but this question popped into my head and I cannot for the life of me find a definitive answer. So I know the nail starts growing from the bottom up and I, like anyone who's ever cut their nail too deep, know that until the nail is past the nail bed it is very much still attached to the finger, but my question lies right at the intersection of these two places, How does the nail move upward without the nail bed moving at all. In my head it could only be done via some kind of biological conveyor belt but I don't see how that would work.

And better yet what determines in the nail bed when to "detach" from the nail and let it just hang off the finger as the white part what we cut off when clipping. I'm not sure why but this specific question is really puzzling to me an I can't find any answers online that don't just describe the parts of the nail and what they do, but not HOW they do it?!

Please for my sanity help me figure this out.

Why don't cargo ships use diesel electric like trains do?
We don't use diesel engines to create torque for the wheels on cargo and passenger trains. Instead, we use a diesel generator to create electrical power which then runs the traction motors on the train.

Considering how pollutant cargo ships are (and just how absurdly large those engines are!) why don't they save on the fuel costs and size/expense of the engines, and instead use some sort of electric generation system and electric traction motors for the drive shaft to the propeller(s)?

I know why we don't use nuclear reactors on cargo ships, but if we can run things like aircraft carriers and submarines on electric traction motors for their propulsion why can't we do the same with cargo ships and save on fuel as well as reduce pollution? Is it that they are so large and have so much resistance that only the high torque of a big engine is enough? Or is it a collection of reasons like cost, etc?

If you managed to get a rope over an ocean and tie it tightly to two poles, would it sink or stay above the water?
If a rope was tied to two foot poles on the opposite sides of an ocean, would the rope somehow follow the curvature of the earth and stay two feet above the water, or would the tight rope take a shortcut through the ocean in a straight line? Essentially, would the rope be completely straight or follow the earths curve? I don’t know how to even begin to Google this question.

Edit: I thought simplifying it to a single ocean would make the question easier, but the original post I read was about people standing around the earth, and if people would drown. Someone commented that if the tension was high enough (ignoring human strength and pain tolerance, that’s why I switched to rope) they would only get their feet wet as if standing on water. I didn’t understand how this would be possible, but I have a hard time getting a grasp on gravity on a planetary scale, so I thought I might not know the full extent. Obviously in real life people would not only either drown or float, even getting them in the middle of the ocean would be an issue.

Why is grapefruit warned against in medicines but not citris fruits?
Iirc, I learned that grapefruits can block certain enzymes in medicine,and the reason it's cautioned against eating grapefruit with most medicine is because it can cause a buildup of it. So if grapefruit causes it, would it be because grapefruit has a particular chemical that other citrus fruits don't? 
Or is it that citrus fruits do interfere, just not as much as grapefruit? Because if it interfered at the same strength grapefruit does, I'd assume the warning on medicines would be akin to "don't take with citrus products" instead of grapefruit specifically.

And how many generations are there for each between then and now?

Why does eating contaminated meat spread prion disease?

Why did gympie-gympie go nuclear?
It makes sense with cone snails; so much in the ocean wants to eat them.  It makes sense with gaboon vipers; their venom does their digesting for them.

But what the hell drove the gympie to develop such a viciously painful neurotoxin?  What was eating or destroying it so successfully that the plant developed the world's most agonizing coat of stinging needles?  Do we even know?  Or is the gympie a giant botanical middle finger for reasons yet to be fathomed?

There is no medication to treat it, according to the CDC.

Why is sleeping so universally important?
Why is it that EVERY animal needs to sleep?

Everything I've read online only gives super minor benefits that don't really justify forcing every animal to be functionally useless for 1/3rd of their lives. How can it be THAT important?!

Sea mammals, like dolphins and whales, needed to evolve so that half of their brain sleeps while the other half keeps them from drowning. Why is easier to evolve this half-brain sleep function than it is to evolve to just not sleep?

Is elephant riding actually bad for elephants?
Looking on the internet, I could only find one study published (PMC8388651). There are a lot of articles online by nobodies claiming that it is bad for their spine. Wondering if any elephant experts have any input on this. I am quite doubtful, considering I can easily carry a 70kg person around, and I am a 70kg person bipedal, while asian elephants weigh 3000kg to 4000kg, and horses weigh as low as 500kg (although the elephant in tourism would typically carry up to 3 people).

Why does HSV-1 Not Transfer to other parts of the body?

Is it possible to contain light, and if so, would this result in an increase in its mass?
Hello everyone, I’d love to hear your opinions. Is it possible to effectively contain light in some way, and if so, would this containment result in an increase in its mass or energy? While light is typically considered massless in classical physics, could certain conditions or interactions cause it to behave differently, perhaps gaining an effective mass or experiencing an increase in its energy? I’m curious to know if there are theoretical or experimental perspectives that support this idea, and how it might relate to concepts like energy, gravity, or particle physics.

'Space is cold' claim - is it?
Hey there, folks who know more science than me.  I was listening to a recent daily Economist podcast earlier today and there was a claim that in the very near future that data centres in space may make sense. Central to the rationale was that 'space is cold', which would help with the waste heat produced by data centres. I thought that (based largely on reading a bit of sci fi) getting rid of waste heat in space was a significant problem, making such a proposal a non-starter. Can you explain if I am missing something here??

what was the "membrane" in diphtheria?
I am reading about the history of medicine and they mention people dying of diphtheria because of a "membrane" that would develop in the throat and restrict breathing. Why couldn't the doctors manually remove it or make a hole in it so the patient could breathe? Would a tracheotomy have helped?
